# Login Page

Login page, frontend built in html, tailwindcss, and javascript. Backend built in python (flask). I was going for like a galaxy theme... but I'm terrible at making things look good. Fully working, will bugfix.

‚ö†PLEASE DO NOT DOS/DDOS MY BACKEND (it probably wont work) AND PLEASE REPORT ANY VULNERABILITIES‚ö†Ô∏è

# Self Hosting

I didn't really center this around self-hosting, more around demo. Though it is still possible: with a little bit of code editing...

1. ```git clone``` this repo
2. Go into every js file and replace the ```https://backend-duuy.onrender.com``` with ```http://localhost:80/``` (or whatever port you're hosting the server on)
3. Create venv using ```python3 -m venv .```, then use ```source bin/activate```
4. Navigate to backend using ```cd backend```, then run ```python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install dependencies
5. ```cd ..``` and then do ```python3 main.py```
